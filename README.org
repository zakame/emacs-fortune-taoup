#+TITLE: fortune-taoup --- Fortune cookies from The Art of Unix Programming and friends

#+CAPTION: Running =M-x fortune-taoup= to get a sample screenshot
[[./screenshot.png]]

A simple Emacs extension to show words of wisdom from the =fortune=-like
tool, [[https://github.com/globalcitizen/taoup][taoup]].

* Quick Start

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package fortune-taoup
    :load-path "to/where/you/cloned/fortune-taoup"
    :if (executable-find "taoup-fortune")
    :custom
    (fortune-taoup-text-scale 6 "Slightly larger text for my $WORK laptop.")
    :config
    (setq initial-buffer-choice
          (lambda ()
            (toggle-frame-fullscreen)
            (fortune-taoup))))
  #+end_src

* Notes

** TODO Use =taoup= directly instead of =taoup-fortune=

   The latter script is an example tool that gives single statements at
   random - maybe let this extension manage all of them instead?

** TODO Add a basic test and CI

   Test is something simple enough like getting a random line, and CI is
   likely GitHub Actions.
   
** TODO Publish to [[https://melpa.org][MELPA]], or not...

   This extension is simple enough to [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa][quelpa]] instead, but we'll see...
